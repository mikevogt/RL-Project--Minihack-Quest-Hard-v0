# RL Project: Minihack-Quest-Hard-v0
 This Github repository serves as the source code for completing the Minihack-Quest-Hard-v0 using Reinforcement Learning.
 
 Minihack is a wrapper environment around the nethack domain, created by the Facebook Research division. We implement the Duelling Double Deep-Q Learning and REINFORCE agents in an attempt to complete the Minihack-Quest-Hard-v0 environment - currently the most difficult environment provided by Minihack - without creating your own one. The agents can be found in the Agents folder.
 
 To run each agent, simply clone this github repositoy. Locate the agents folder you want to train within \Agents. 
 
 To run the Duelling Double Deep-Q Learning agent, open the folder in your terminal and run: $python train_nethack.py.
 To run the Duelling Reinforce agent, open the folder in your terminal and run: $python train_nethack.py.
 
 To run these agents on different environments, open the .py file in your preferred IDE, choose an environment and repeat the run step above.
 To view the results of each agent, locate the associated agents folder within \Models and Results. There we have split the Quest-Hard-v0 into its 4 subquests, with models and their training reward and loss csv.'s saved for each agent.
